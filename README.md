# SPARC Nanofabrication Program — Phase-2 Project

Indo-Taiwan/US Collaborative Program | IIT Hyderabad

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during Phase-2 of the SPARC Nanofabrication Program at IIT Hyderabad. The program focused on hands-on training in semiconductor cleanroom fabrication techniques followed by device-oriented research modules.

The project involved the synthesis, fabrication, and characterization of two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials and their application in gas sensing devices.

## Cleanroom Training

The first half of the program provided practical training in micro/nanofabrication processes, covering the full workflow from substrate preparation to pattern transfer.
